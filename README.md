# NewtonSoftVsSystemText
This application compares the performance of two libraries that handle JSON serialization and deserialization in .NET 8: Newtonsoft.Json (third-party) and System.Text.Json (built-in).
# JSON Performance Comparison: Newtonsoft.Json vs System.Text.Json

This project benchmarks the performance of two popular JSON libraries in .NET: `Newtonsoft.Json` and `System.Text.Json`. The application measures and compares their serialization and deserialization speeds to determine which library offers better performance under various conditions.

## Introduction

In the .NET ecosystem, `Newtonsoft.Json` (also known as Json.NET) and `System.Text.Json` are widely used for handling JSON data. This project aims to provide a detailed performance comparison between these two libraries, focusing on their serialization and deserialization capabilities.

## About the Project

The application benchmarks the following scenarios:

- Serialization of complex objects to JSON
- Deserialization of JSON back into objects
- Handling of large data sets
- Comparison of memory usage

## Features

- Performance benchmarks for serialization and deserialization
- Detailed comparison of `Newtonsoft.Json` and `System.Text.Json`
- Output of results in a clear and concise format
- Easy-to-use and extensible benchmarking framework
